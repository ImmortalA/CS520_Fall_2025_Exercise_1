# Part 2: Self-Repair Guide

## Failures to Debug (from results.csv)

You have 7 failures to choose from. Pick at least 2:

### Recommended Failures:

1. **humaneval_25 / mistral / cot** - TIMEOUT (clear algorithmic issue)
2. **humaneval_54 / mistral / cot** - FAILED (logic error)
3. **humaneval_108 / gemini / cot** - FAILED (edge case)

---

## How to Generate Self-Repair Solutions

### Step 1: Analyze the Failure

**For humaneval_25 / mistral / cot:**

1. Open: `llm-codegen/generations/humaneval_25/mistral/cot/cot_sample1.py`
2. Open: `llm-codegen/tests/test_humaneval_25.py`
3. Open: `llm-codegen/data/humaneval_25.json`

**Problem**: The code times out on large prime numbers because it increments `divisor += 1` without optimization.

---

### Step 2: Create Self-Repair Prompt

Use the template from `prompts/self_repair_generic.txt`:

```
You are given a failing function implementation and failing test feedback.

Goal: Produce a corrected implementation that fixes the described failures while preserving the contract.

Procedure:
- Diagnose the cause using the failing inputs/expected outputs.
- Propose a minimal, correct fix.
- Provide only the corrected function implementation; no prints.

Problem: Return list of prime factors of given integer in order from smallest to largest.

Failing implementation:
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    if n == 1:
        return []
    factors = []
    divisor = 2
    while n > 1:
        while n % divisor == 0:
            factors.append(divisor)
            n = n // divisor
        divisor += 1
    return factors

Test case that failed:
Input: factorize(9999999967) - a large prime number
Expected: [9999999967]
Actual: TIMEOUT (execution exceeded 10 seconds)

Expected behavior:
The function should efficiently factorize large numbers by only checking divisors up to sqrt(n), then recognizing remaining n > 1 as a prime factor.

IMPORTANT: Output ONLY the corrected function code.
```

### Step 3: Generate with API

**Option A: Use Gemini API**
```python
import os
import google.generativeai as genai

genai.configure(api_key=os.environ["GEMINI_API_KEY"])
model = genai.GenerativeModel('models/gemini-2.5-flash')

prompt = """[paste the self-repair prompt above]"""

response = model.generate_content(prompt)
print(response.text)
```

**Option B: Use Mistral API**
```python
import os
from mistralai import Mistral

client = Mistral(api_key=os.environ["MISTRAL_API_KEY"])

prompt = """[paste the self-repair prompt above]"""

response = client.chat.complete(
    model="mistral-large-latest",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert Python programmer."},
        {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
    ]
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

---

### Step 4: Save the Fixed Code

Save the LLM's response to:
`llm-codegen/generations/humaneval_25/mistral/self_repair/self_repair_sample1.py`

---

## Repeat for All Failures

### For humaneval_54 / mistral / cot:

**Self-Repair Prompt:**
```
You are given a failing function implementation and failing test feedback.

Problem: Check if two words have the same characters.

Failing implementation:
from collections import Counter

def same_chars(s0: str, s1: str) -> bool:
    return Counter(s0) == Counter(s1)

Test case that failed:
Input: same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddeddabc')
Expected: True
Actual: False

Expected behavior:
Function should return True if both strings contain the same SET of unique characters (frequency doesn't matter).

Example:
- 'abc' and 'aabbcc' should return True (both have {a,b,c})
- 'abc' and 'abd' should return False (different character sets)

IMPORTANT: Output ONLY the corrected function code.
```

### For humaneval_108 / gemini / cot:

**Self-Repair Prompt:**
```
You are given a failing function implementation and failing test feedback.

Problem: Count how many numbers in array have sum of digits > 0. For negative numbers, first digit is negative.

Failing implementation:
[paste the failing code from humaneval_108/gemini/cot/cot_sample1.py]

Test case that failed:
Input: count_nums([-1, 11, -11])
Expected: 1
Actual: [your actual output]

Expected behavior:
-1 has digits: -1 (sum = -1, not > 0)
11 has digits: 1, 1 (sum = 2, > 0) ✓
-11 has digits: -1, 1 (sum = 0, not > 0)
Result: 1

For negative numbers:
- Convert to string, remove '-' sign
- First digit becomes negative, rest positive
- -123 = -1 + 2 + 3 = 4

IMPORTANT: Output ONLY the corrected function code.
```

## After Generating All Fixes

Run evaluation again:
```cmd
python llm-codegen\eval\run_eval.py
```

Check that `self_repair` entries now show `pass@1 = 1.000`!

---

## For Your Report

Document for each failure:
1. Original failing code
2. Self-repair prompt used
3. Fixed code (from LLM)
4. Analysis of why it failed
5. Why the fix works
6. Comparison across families

---

## Summary

- ✅ I created the self_repair folders
- ✅ Showed you how to generate fixes using APIs
- ✅ Provided exact self-repair prompts
- ⏳ YOU generate the fixes using Gemini/Mistral APIs
- ⏳ Save to self_repair folders
- ⏳ Re-run evaluation

This ensures academic integrity - the fixes come from LLMs, not manual coding!
