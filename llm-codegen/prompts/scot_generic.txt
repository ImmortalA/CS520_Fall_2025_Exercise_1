Task: Implement the target function as specified.

Stepwise Chain-of-Thought Plan:
1) Restate the function contract precisely.
2) Identify edge cases and constraints.
3) Outline a step-by-step algorithm.
4) Implement the function in Python, adhering to the contract.
5) Double-check correctness on edge cases.

Output: Only the function implementation; no extra prints.
