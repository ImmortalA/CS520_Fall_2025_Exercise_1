# Part 1 Complete - Summary

## ‚úÖ What You've Accomplished

### Generation (40 files)
- ‚úÖ 20 Gemini solutions (10 problems √ó 2 strategies)
- ‚úÖ 20 Mistral solutions (10 problems √ó 2 strategies)

### Evaluation
- ‚úÖ All 40 solutions tested against HumanEval+ test suites
- ‚úÖ Results written to `llm-codegen/eval/results.csv`
- ‚úÖ Terminal output saved to `llm-codegen/eval/eval_terminal_result.txt`

### Results Summary
- **Overall Success**: 33/40 (82.5%)
- **Gemini**: 19/20 (95%)
  - CoT: 9/10 (90%)
  - SCoT: 10/10 (100%)
- **Mistral**: 14/20 (70%)
  - CoT: 7/10 (70%)
  - SCoT: 7/10 (70%)

### Failures Identified (7 cases)
Perfect for Part 2 debugging:

1. **humaneval_25** / mistral / cot - TIMEOUT (algorithmic inefficiency)
2. **humaneval_25** / mistral / scot - TIMEOUT (algorithmic inefficiency)
3. **humaneval_54** / mistral / cot - FAILED (logic error)
4. **humaneval_54** / mistral / scot - FAILED (logic error)
5. **humaneval_108** / gemini / cot - FAILED (edge case handling)
6. **humaneval_108** / mistral / cot - FAILED (edge case handling)
7. **humaneval_108** / mistral / scot - FAILED (edge case handling)

## üìä Key Findings

### What Worked Well:
- Both models excel at straightforward algorithmic problems
- Gemini + SCoT = 100% success rate
- 7/10 problems solved perfectly by all strategies

### What Failed:
- Mistral's factorize: inefficient algorithm (no sqrt optimization)
- Mistral's same_chars: logic error in character comparison
- count_nums: complex negative number handling

### Insights:
- SCoT helps Gemini but not Mistral
- More capable models benefit more from structured prompts
- Algorithmic optimization knowledge varies between families

## üéØ Next Steps (Part 2 & 3)

### Part 2: Debugging (Required)
Choose at least 2 failures from the 7 identified above:

**Recommended:**
1. humaneval_25 / mistral / cot (timeout issue - clear cause)
2. humaneval_108 / gemini / cot (edge case - interesting comparison)

For each:
- Analyze why it failed
- Use self-repair prompting
- Generate fixed version
- Re-evaluate
- Document before/after

### Part 3: Innovation
- Create a novel prompting strategy
- Test on both families
- Compare results vs CoT/SCoT
